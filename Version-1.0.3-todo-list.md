### three weeks?

### Image Rework
- ~~use jpg as default (which compression factor?)~~
- ~~don't generate thumbnails (atm new grid view does not support images at different sizes)~~
- ~~migrate from old version~~
 - ~~Delete thumbnails~~
 - ~~Run background thread to convert pngs to jpg (save disk space, avoid hard drive as bottleneck for loading grid images)~~
 - ~~save image format in core data so we keep track of which images to convert between launches~~
 - ~~Add indicator for migration progress~~
 - ~~Improve behaviour when migration fails for an image (usually caused by missing artwork file, remove box image, schedule for syncing if automatic lookup is enabled)~~
 
***

### Grid Rework
- ~~Fix drag~~
- ~~Fix drop (highlight & don't accept images on whole view)~~
- ~~Improve layout (http://imgur.com/a/QNQBM, new grid at bottom)~~

***

### Core Data Rewirte
- Fix moving game library folder
- check save states
- check rom lookup (after import, initiated by context menu, on app launch)
- reduce core data saves
 - OpenVGDB sync could save every 5 seconds or after x items
 - same for importer
- check how openvgdb lookup behaves when no internet connection is available
- see if reloading collection view can be optimised (right now we reload on every main context save)
- Test Importer
 - Single roms
 - Directories
 - Large data set
 - Lookup
 - Copy / organize
 - Archives roms
 - Multi-rom archives
 - arcade (multi-file archive, single rom)
 - cd based systems (bin / cue), especially issue resolving

***

### Misc
- Fix input issues :P
- can we keep track of battery saves?
- ~~are OpenVGDB ids persistent? should we add them to the core data store?~~
- ~~add default cover art aspect ratio to system plugins (localised)~~
- add support for multi-rom archives (is the stuff in multi-rom-archives branch working?)
 - ~~import~~
 - ~~deletion~~
 - ~~launching~~
 - ~~lookup~~
 - ~~migration~~, not tested, but should be fine
 - ~~move library~~
 - ~~save state directories~~
- ~~Fix coredata deadlock on quit (caused by saving child contexts when app terminates, temporarily fixed by ignoring changes in child contexts)~~
- rewrite secrets pane (tableview based)
- fix database debug actions
- improve warning when a core is missing (also don't show that warning if core download was cancelled)
