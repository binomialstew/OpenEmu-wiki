1. Game cores should download from server during setup assistant instead of looking in the Cores folder for plugins.
2. <s>System plugins should be bundled and read from the app. Keep Systems folder too.</s>
3. Decide how to handle the "Update Bundles" function in the menu. Currently it only seems to work if the Cores tab is open in Preferences.
4. <s>Make sure the Sparkle updater works for updating the app. "Check for Updates" is not enabled in the menu.</s>
5. Update server with latest built cores.
6. Fix broken popout window.
7. Any last setup assistant issues?
8. How about some good kick pants?
