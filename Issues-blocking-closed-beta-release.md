1. Game cores should download from server during setup assistant instead of looking in the Cores folder for plugins.
2. System plugins should be bundled and read from the app. Remove Systems folder then?
3. Decide how to handle the "Update Bundles" function in the menu. Currently it only seems to work if the Cores tab is open in Preferences.
4. Make sure the Sparkle updater works for updating the app. "Check for Updates" is not enabled in the menu.
5. Update server with latest built cores.
6. Fix broken popout window.
7. Any last setup assistant issues?
8. How about some good kick pants?
