Like many emulators, OpenEmu allows the use of [cheat codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games) to change the way a game plays (invincibility, level skipping, etc.).

Cheat-code support in OpenEmu is determined by each [core](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki/User-guide:-Preferences:-Cores) and its underlying emulation code. Some cores do not support cheat codes; OpenEmu knows which cores those are, and its cheat functionality will not be available when they are in use.

### Finding cheats

A good resource for finding cheat codes is [GameHacking.org](http://gamehacking.org).

**Important**: Be sure that the codes you use are for the proper region of the game you are playing. Since there can be different versions of a game for various locales, there are also different codes that have to be used. For example: cheat codes for a US version of a game may not work for an EU version of a game.

### Adding cheats

To add a cheat code, you must be running a game. Within the game window, move the mouse to produce the [HUD bar](#), and click the cog/gear icon near the center. If the core supports cheat codes, a menu item called *Select Cheat* will be available. In this menu, there will be another item labelled *Add Cheat...* — click here to input a new code.

In the dialogue that opens, you can enter a name for the cheat (to identify it in the *Select Cheat* menu), as well as the code itself. Enter codes in whatever format the core supports; usually, these formats will be identical to the most popular cheat devices available for the system in question (such as Action Replay or Game Genie). You can also choose to enable a cheat right away or wait to enable it later.

For multi-line codes, use a plus (`+`) to separate each line. For example: `AVSOYOSZ+ELEAPOZE+AIEAZPAP`

### Using cheats

After you've added a cheat, you'll need to enable it if you haven't already. Return to the *Select Cheat* menu, and you will now see the cheat that was just added in the list. Click on it to enable it. If you need to disable it later, simply return to this menu and click it again.

### Limitations

OpenEmu currently has no way of saving cheats — any codes entered will be lost as soon as you leave the game. Improved cheat-code functionality (potentially including a built-in database of codes) is planned for a future version of the application.
