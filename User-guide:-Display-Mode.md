Some cores support the ability to change different display options.  This is accessed by mapping "Display Mode" to a Keyboard/Controller button in [Preferences > Controls](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki/User-guide:-Preferences:-Controls).

Currently, four systems support Display Mode:

### Atari 2600
While playing Atari 2600 press the Display Mode button to cycle through NTSC/PAL/SECAM palettes and modes.

### Nintendo DS
Sometimes, having an extra screen on the DS is unnecessary.  Display Mode lets you choose between showing both screens, just the top screen, or just the touch screen so that you can optimize your screen space.

Note: 

Support for changing the palette in Game Boy games in the Gambatte core is coming in the future.
