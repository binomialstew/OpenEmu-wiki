OpenEmu supports filters for those who wish to clean up or otherwise alter the look of their games.

You can install your own by dragging and dropping [`.cg` files](https://github.com/libretro/common-shaders) onto the library, just like ROMs.  However, unlike ROMs, you must restart OpenEmu for the filter to be available for use.
