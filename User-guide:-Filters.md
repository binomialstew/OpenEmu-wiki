OpenEmu supports filters for those who wish to clean up or otherwise alter the look of their games.

You can install your own by dragging and dropping filters in<code>.cg</code> files onto the library, just like ROMs.  However, unlike ROMs, you must restart OpenEmu for the filter to be available for use.
