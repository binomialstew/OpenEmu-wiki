### three weeks?

***

### Image Rework
- use jpg as default (which compression factor?)
- don't generate thumbnails (atm new grid view does not support images at different sizes)
- migrate from old version
 - Delete thumbnails
 - Run background thread to convert pngs to jpg (save disk space, avoid hard drive as bottleneck for loading grid images)
 - save image format in core data so we keep track of which images to convert between launches

***

### Grid Rework
- Fix drag
- Fix drop (highlight & don't accept images on whole view)
- Improve layout (http://imgur.com/a/QNQBM, new grid at bottom)

***

### Misc
- Fix input issues :P
- can we keep track of battery saves?
- ~~are OpenVGDB ids persistent? should we add them to the core data store?~~
- ~~add default cover art aspect ratio to system plugins (localised)~~
