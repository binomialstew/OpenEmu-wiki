Guys,


Trying to play Tomb Raider 1 and 2 on Openemu on my MacBook pro. After unecmed the file and created the corresponding cue, I was able to launch the game. However, after selecting the start option, black screen popped up for both Tomb Raider. I do have all the Bios and OpenEmu is v.2.0.6.1


bty, i've played PSX games such Mega Man X4,5,6 before and they worked fine. 



Suggestions?
