### New UI To Do List

### Priority
* Archive.VG API inclusion
    * * Rename rom files with tosec name from archive.vg response
* Cores Preference pane _no core details for now_
    * Decide how to handle the "Update Bundles" function in the menu. Currently it only seems to work if the Cores tab is open in Preferences.
    * Install Cores after download
    * Fix sparkle errors!

* ### General Stuff
* give Game Window pop out a hud look
* Fix OESearchFieldCell (loses text attributes after enter-key was pressed)
* Remember state of collections item (collapsed/expanded)
* rewrite main library split view and correctly remember/restore last sidebar width

* Setup Assistant: 
    * <strike>Game Scanner</strike>
    *    * Additional Sources

### Eventually
* Remove ivars since we are now 64 bit clean

### Organization
* Organize code, remove unecessary files
* Replace copyright headers
* <strike>Agreed upon code guidelines?</strike> [Style Guide](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki/Style-Guide)
