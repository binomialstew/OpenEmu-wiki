Some cores support the ability to change different display options.  This option is accessed by mapping "Display Mode" to a Keyboard / Controller button in Preferences > Controls.
Currently, only three systems support Display Mode:

### NES
When using the Nestopia core, pressing the Display Mode button will cycle through palette options.

### Virtual Boy
Display mode cycles through different palettes and [Anaglyph 3D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D) options.

### Nintendo DS
