Some cores support the ability to change different display options.  This option is accessed by mapping "Display Mode" to a Keyboard/Controller button in [Preferences > Controls](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki/User-guide:-Mapping-Controls).

Currently, only three systems support Display Mode:

### NES
When using the Nestopia core, pressing the Display Mode button will cycle various palettes.

### Virtual Boy
Display mode cycles through different palettes and [Anaglyph 3D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D) options.

### Nintendo DS
Sometimes, having an extra screen on the DS is unnecessary and wasteful of screen real estate.  Display Mode lets you choose between showing both screens, just the top screen, or just the touch screen.

Note: 

Support for changing the GameBoy palette in Gambatte is coming in the future.
