Some cores support the ability to change different display options.  This option is accessed by mapping "Display Mode" to a Keyboard / Controller button in Preferences > Controls.
Currently, only three systems support Display Mode:

### NES
When using the Nestopia core, pressing the Display Mode button will cycle through palette options.
### Virtual Boy
### Nintendo DS
