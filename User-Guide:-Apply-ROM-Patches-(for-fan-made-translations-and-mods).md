In order to emulate games with a patch, you first need to apply the patch to the original game, and then play the resulting game. This means you have to "merge" the patch into the original game ROM, and the new, resulting file is the one you have to add to OpenEmu.

The recommended way to patch games on Mac is with [MultiPatch](http://projects.sappharad.com/tools/multipatch.html).
