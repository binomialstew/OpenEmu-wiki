OpenEmu currently does not have a Help menu or a manual (see [issue # 893](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/issues/893)). In lieu of this, for now, the following pages may be used as a sort of user guide:

* [[User guide: BIOS files]]
* [[User guide: Cheat codes]]
* [[User guide: Cue sheets — loading CD based games]]
* [[User guide: Preferences Window]]
* [[User guide: Save states]]
* [[User guide: Wiimote and Wii U Pro pairing]]

(Work in progress)
