## 2.0 Show-stopping bugs to be patched in point release
-   ~~When launching a game requiring a BIOS file that prompts you to install a Core, OE will not properly import the BIOS file on drag in drop until the app is restarted, instead placing the file in the game library. Example steps to replicate: Close the application, delete CrabEmu.oecoreplugin from your Cores folder, delete 'coleco.rom' from your BIOS folder, launch the application, try to play a Colecovision game, get prompted to download and install the CrabEmu core, game tries to launch but will prompt you for the BIOS files, drag and drop in the required 'coleco.rom' but instead of the importer detecting it as a BIOS file, it will want to end up in your game library. Only restarting the app after installing the CrabEmu core can you properly import the 'coleco.rom' BIOS file. Example case https://twitter.com/Rickyzgz/status/680099300085465088~~ - acb865afd0a4211f4ae8a509a02d9fbfbc3b2c9d

##### Fixed 2.0 Bugs

- ~~Some users are not seeing the new systems appear in Library under Preferences, still unknown why. Sources: https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenEmu/comments/3y24yz/i_updated_to_20_but_none_of_the_new_systems_are/ & https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/issues/2225~~ 72e105885e5c62dc1bbf02f918090e3f11928d02

## Version Next
- rename all unused auto saves in a game to 'restored auto save'
- import screenshots without 100% match into 'Unknown' category
- check for weird save state duplicates on first start of new version
- Use array controller and improve core data fetching in save state manager

### unordered
- setting second player's controls https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/issues/1861, should have been fixed in https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu-SDK/commit/4415e6bc72e57d3af74860e1ff0e55f1bd7d3f95

## Bugs and Crashes
 - App crash when launching a game. Happened with Nestopia at the time but can happen with any core (https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c6c040e9fe70ef2f1f0b & SNES9x: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5ffddc76286eb98bbaff & GenesisPlusGX: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/25496fab9c6751bd6ef1 & https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7fee33ea62f179a06d61 & https://gist.github.com/anonymous/40a9b963ac547e28d227 )

### Probably wontfix
 - Another exception. Can't remember the exact details when it occurred but I could no longer right click on anything in the grid view (https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8478b6f2d3da018af53b)
 - (Rare?) Had this crash some times while launching the app (https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d239235e177d4813dfe9 & https://gist.github.com/anonymous/45307fefff5fdc6f67b6 & https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c0282c14dd7476fc5d43)

- type select select in menus (eg console selection in controls settings) _not sure if this ever worked -cy_

## UI bugs
- The "Recently Added" collection was able to be deleted with the Delete key in 1.0.4, so there will be users who have deleted it with no way to get it back. Suggestion: in a point release, add an "Added" date column to the list view, which would make "Recently Added" redundant, and just remove it for everyone.
- fullscreen transition for games running in main window is not smooth
- resizing a running game window (main window or popout) can produce flickering garbage

### Completed UI bugfixes/changes
- ~~If in list mode, selecting another non-empty collection re-enables the zoom slider in the toolbar.~~ b949b04589b42058a6b73fdd8920cb00fcb40063
- ~~restore game collection view state (zoom, selection, view type, search) *[Is this still accurate? These things seem to already be persisted.]*~~ _should be ok for now_
- ~~table views: use the standard look with Source List style + visual effect view? *[Is it conventional for non-source list table views to have a source list style and vibrancy? Would a table view with vibrancy sitting next to the sidebar with vibrancy be too much darned vibrancy? Also keep in mind that behind-window vibrancy and within-window vibrancy can't mix.]*~~ _should be ok for now_
- ~~'start game' menu item should probably also work for the games in the save states manager~~ -e5d9771072e0d43ef805bfed629ceb1b2f57a34a
- ~~review NSViewController+OEAdditions.m, NSColor+OEAdditions.m~~ ~~and OENonARCHacks.m to see if we still need "no ARC" hacks `-fno-objc-arc`~~ 4e57bc8565f44ec1a75ff6d05bbc51e9886193c2, 925df43afde59e9a72d6a7e64aad1e4173536397

- ~~investigate "Blurry images on non-retina screens" https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/issues/2215 further example: 1.0.4 (http://i.imgur.com/HXHJ4i9.png) vs 2.0 (http://i.imgur.com/TPV5yjr.png)~~ 344671e9ecfac024f8493ca3a58ff5d509807139
- ~~transition from Other Collections to Library has a slight 'pop' in the sidebar at the end of the animation *[Could it be the NSVisualEffectView, or what's behind it, going from inactive state to active state?]*~~ bdc38ad31ddefe1d417a57f86a8cc551fb91a105 *[This doesn't completely resolve the issue but is a workaround to lessen the effect.]*
- ~~buttons in the other collections besides the library should have no state~~ af54cfa56b770c1324ce1af9fb5704a0eb3572df
- ~~toolbar bug: go to the main library, switch to list view, then switch to save states, then perform a search in the toolbar (notice it resets the button), then switch back to the library. you'll notice that the grid button has been toggled but you are still in list view.~~ af54cfa56b770c1324ce1af9fb5704a0eb3572df
- ~~for some reason it is impossible to deselect gambatte in setup assistant~~ _this was intentional to resolve some user headaches -clobber https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/commit/002ede42aaf20f1590934cf9e1eb54ccbe9bc2ee_
- ~~"Start Game" menu item is disabled in the main window and cannot be used to launch a game. It also enables while playing a game in the main window.~~ -5228791cab7f3c1bcbd6c2c72aff35e95b85f1e7
- ~~Switching from the main library in list view to another category and back will cause controls in the library to be disabled and not persist the correct selected button state.~~ f0f4ac8edfaf342778ddb029f36a2ebe899dd56e and f75ce661df366d2b936cf09c2dc74fe37fa5d878
- ~~isSidebarVisible needs to be removed from OELibrarySplit view, since now that we don't support that people on 1.0.4 with their collapsed sidebar will also find their sidebar is collapse on 2.0 with no way to fix it~~ 141319844f10c8d712dbc6475e1cd20120ad49f0

- ~~bug: 'Recently Added' collection in the sidebar affected by a bug involving importDate: ZIMPORTDATE is null for a newly imported game on a clean library. Dates back to at least 1.0.4.~~ 8bb76685337daa3f8d0ec395243210d31e37b69f
- ~~bug: "clicking the list view column titles leaves untidy white lines" https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/issues/2200~~ -0f5f64c
- ~~transition to the Homebrew collection has a longer delay than the rest of the collections. The usual crossfade animation occurs when the delay completes. The delay lasts the length of the transition duration, and setting the duration to 0 eliminates the delay (at the cost of eliminating the crossfade animation). The delay does not happen for the first transition to the homebrew collection.~~ 729a832 
- ~~bug: issue resolver is still glitching https://transfer.sh/xF3yV/screen-shot-2015-12-14-at-23.10.45.png~~ a9e11acb724c7ac643a7ca5ce8faa48dde8576ca
- ~~bug: konami code is broken~~ 3d67687061073d4f46c4479a6d027af69a7ac3ef
- ~~bug: the "hide" context menu action for hiding a library no longer works until the preferences window is shown. This is because the preferences window is now lazily loaded, and so there's nothing listening for OESidebarTogglesSystemNotification until OEPrefLibraryController gets initialized.~~ f7dade9e9a3dde3686c598f61f58bcfc56035059
- ~~bug: Launching a game in the library window from list mode and then exiting the game switches the library window to grid mode.~~ 5deb7b9970defe4a59ca612ec8abe9dd12c8c03e
- ~~bug: Importing a game in list mode switches the library window to grid mode.~~ 5deb7b9970defe4a59ca612ec8abe9dd12c8c03e

- ~~bug: since the toolbar change to the preferences (a7dcd04ef2d213abefb5a0d49bc770655d6aef0c), only clicking the icon will change tabs instead of before where clicking the 'text' label would also work~~ b5fa707812f697e3dbe0a37cae0315575003c40c
- ~~OpenEmu's preference tab icons are 36x36, but NSToolbarItem uses HIG-specified icon size of 32x32, causing noticeable scaling. Before/after conversion to NSTabViewController: http://i.imgur.com/FWSyIJQ.png~~ d39d151699fad633363949d874a2c4035d0aab83

- ~~restore selected sidebar item~~
- ~~maybe adjust space between grid cover and selector ring again? http://i.imgur.com/206lkMO.png~~ 953fd8c4fc972665de7596555a2c32159733369f
- ~~grid/list controls don't enable until after transitions when changing Collections and looks odd. remove the delay so they happen in response to the button click and not the animation.~~ 1f3c71da0f70f98bb8bc3231ade116e04f961864
