## Bugs and Crashes
 - App crash when launching a game. Happened with Nestopia at the time but can happen with any core (https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c6c040e9fe70ef2f1f0b & SNES9x: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5ffddc76286eb98bbaff & GenesisPlusGX: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/25496fab9c6751bd6ef1 & https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7fee33ea62f179a06d61 & https://gist.github.com/anonymous/40a9b963ac547e28d227 )

### Probably wontfix
 - Another exception. Can't remember the exact details when it occurred but I could no longer right click on anything in the grid view (https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8478b6f2d3da018af53b)
 - (Rare?) Had this crash some times while launching the app (https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d239235e177d4813dfe9 & https://gist.github.com/anonymous/45307fefff5fdc6f67b6 & https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c0282c14dd7476fc5d43)

## UI change
- bug: query entered into searchbox doesn’t persist after game play but the results do. expected: search string should also persist in the box after game play.
- bug: during gameplay, titlebar cuts off the gameview http://i.imgur.com/laMOjtR.png
- bug: game scanner view doesn't pop up when there are import issues to resolve.
- crash: search field-related. steps to replicate: enter search in library mode, click another category like save states, click back to library category, enter in a search again (notice it won't actually filter and give a result), switch back to save states yet again, then switch back to library once more, enter a search, crash: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0105333cd1c4e03eb42a
