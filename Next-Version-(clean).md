## Bugs and Crashes
 - App crash when launching a game. Happened with Nestopia at the time but can happen with any core (https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c6c040e9fe70ef2f1f0b & SNES9x: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5ffddc76286eb98bbaff & GenesisPlusGX: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/25496fab9c6751bd6ef1 & https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7fee33ea62f179a06d61 & https://gist.github.com/anonymous/40a9b963ac547e28d227 )

### Probably wontfix
 - Another exception. Can't remember the exact details when it occurred but I could no longer right click on anything in the grid view (https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8478b6f2d3da018af53b)
 - (Rare?) Had this crash some times while launching the app (https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d239235e177d4813dfe9 & https://gist.github.com/anonymous/45307fefff5fdc6f67b6 & https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c0282c14dd7476fc5d43)

## UI change
- bug: fullscreen transition for games running in main window is not smooth
- bug: resizing a running game window (main window or popout) can produce flickering garbage
- bug: In the gameplay popout window, going to fullscreen and then out of fullscreen causes the window title text to disappear.
- bug: ~~"clicking the list view column titles leaves untidy white lines" https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/issues/2200 ~~ -0f5f64c
- restore game collection view state (zoom, selection, view type, search)
- transition from Other Collections to Library has a slight 'pop' in the sidebar at the end of the animation, seems NSVisualEffectView-related 
- table views: use the standard look with Source List style + visual effect view?

### Completed
- ~~transition to the Homebrew collection has a longer delay than the rest of the collections. The usual crossfade animation occurs when the delay completes. The delay lasts the length of the transition duration, and setting the duration to 0 eliminates the delay (at the cost of eliminating the crossfade animation). The delay does not happen for the first transition to the homebrew collection.~~ 729a832 
- bug: ~~issue resolver is still glitching https://transfer.sh/xF3yV/screen-shot-2015-12-14-at-23.10.45.png~~ a9e11acb724c7ac643a7ca5ce8faa48dde8576ca
- bug: ~~konami code is broken~~ 3d67687061073d4f46c4479a6d027af69a7ac3ef
- bug: ~~the "hide" context menu action for hiding a library no longer works until the preferences window is shown. This is because the preferences window is now lazily loaded, and so there's nothing listening for OESidebarTogglesSystemNotification until OEPrefLibraryController gets initialized.~~ f7dade9e9a3dde3686c598f61f58bcfc56035059
- ~~bug: Launching a game in the library window from list mode and then exiting the game switches the library window to grid mode.~~ 5deb7b9970defe4a59ca612ec8abe9dd12c8c03e
- ~~bug: Importing a game in list mode switches the library window to grid mode.~~ 5deb7b9970defe4a59ca612ec8abe9dd12c8c03e
- ~~fix modal sheet positioning, probably to sit under the titlebar? https://transfer.sh/4ZRmf/screen-shot-2015-12-11-at-21.24.56.png~~ 223d714852af367201698377ca965cc426dd1701
- ~~preferences window sometimes doesn't resize correctly~~ b5fa707812f697e3dbe0a37cae0315575003c40c
- ~~preferences window doesn't finish animation when it's closed too early~~ b5fa707812f697e3dbe0a37cae0315575003c40c
- ~~bug: since the toolbar change to the preferences (a7dcd04ef2d213abefb5a0d49bc770655d6aef0c), only clicking the icon will change tabs instead of before where clicking the 'text' label would also work~~ b5fa707812f697e3dbe0a37cae0315575003c40c
- ~~OpenEmu's preference tab icons are 36x36, but NSToolbarItem uses HIG-specified icon size of 32x32, causing noticeable scaling. Before/after conversion to NSTabViewController: http://i.imgur.com/FWSyIJQ.png~~ d39d151699fad633363949d874a2c4035d0aab83
- ~~convert Prefs to NSTabViewController so it can manage the toolbar and the window automagically~~ b5fa707812f697e3dbe0a37cae0315575003c40c
- ~~search field flashing carat has a white line at the bottom. redraw issue?~~ c67c48c36b6ddb73c7ac909bfc196ce58d58da88
- ~~bug: after new gradient background view, resizing the main window doesn't look as 'smooth'~~ 2feeee90b621e56de4951fe8b3e91e270790bf2a
- ~~bug: after new gradient background view, double clicking the top titlebar doesn't 'expand' the window.~~ 876d38b41db3131380140ad6821e64c42975607e
- ~~reminder: all the .xib's have been changed so we will probably need to delete most localized ones. probably no time to update them all for localization and we don't want weird crashes.~~
- ~~restore selected sidebar item~~
- ~~maybe adjust space between grid cover and selector ring again? http://i.imgur.com/206lkMO.png~~ 953fd8c4fc972665de7596555a2c32159733369f
- ~~grid/list controls don't enable until after transitions when changing Collections and looks odd. remove the delay so they happen in response to the button click and not the animation.~~ 1f3c71da0f70f98bb8bc3231ade116e04f961864

- ~~bug: if you switch to a different category from library and switch back, then import a game that will prompt the issue resolver, the issue resolver view will be empty unless you resize the window https://i.imgur.com/TsVBcsO.png~~ 0e37dab2ca773a88edb6498f0cf2f0f8cd059ca7
