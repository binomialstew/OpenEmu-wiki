### Mapping Controls

OpenEmu makes it simple to map controls.  It is compatible with keyboard controls and any [HID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_human_interface_device_class) Compliant controller. Simply connect your controller, select it in the "Input" dropdown, and if your controller is on [this list](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki#supported-controllers), it will be auto-mapped.  If your controller is not auto-mapped or you wish to remap some controls from the default, all you have to do is select which button you would like to map to your controller and press the button on the controller to which you would like to map it.

### Special Keys
OpenEmu has the ability to map more than just what the original console supports.  Under the "Special Keys" section in the key mapper, the following features are available:

* [Save](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki/User-guide:-Save-states#manual-save-states)
* [Load](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki/User-guide:-Save-states#loading)
* [Quick Save](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki/User-guide:-Save-states#quick-save-state)

* Fullscreen
* Mute
* Volume Down
* Volume Up
* Reset (Reset emulation)
* Pause (Pause emulation)
* Fast Forward (Fast forwards for the duration of the button press. It is not a toggle!)
* [Display Mode](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki/User-guide:-Display-Mode)

Some of the above are hidden by default and must be manually enabled in the Secret preferences.
