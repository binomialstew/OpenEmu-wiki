Using the guide below, we will try and walk you through the steps required to download and compile the OpenEmu application from source. You will need a Macintosh computer running OSX 10.7 or 10.8. We recommend updating to the latest version and ensuring all software is up to date...

If you have used earlier OpenEmu versions (Version 1.0b7, please see "Cleanup Earlier Versions" at the bottom before compiling OpenEmu)

###Step 1

Download and install the latest copy of XCode from the Mac App Store: <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12> This is free software provided by Apple. It is a hefty download weighing in at 1.5GB at time of writing. So download it, grab a coffee and see you for step 2 once the download is complete!...

###Step 2

With Xcode downloaded and installed on your computer, we now need to clone the source code for OpenEmu. 
Install Github for Mac from <http://mac.github.com/> and create a Github account. Then navigate to the OpenEmu repo <https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu> and click "Clone in Mac"

###Step 3

Once it has finished cloning, browse to the 'OpenEmu' folder it cloned to.

###Step 4

Open the folder called 'OpenEmu' and browse through the files until you find the XCode project file called 'OpenEmu.xcworkspace'. Double click this file and it should launch Xcode....

###Step 5

With Xcode open, you will see a lot of files and 'cores' that make up the OpenEmu application in the left sidebar. At the top of the application you will see a lot of buttons. You need to click on the funky looking long bar and select the correct 'Scheme'...

Click on the left-most portion of this bar, and be sure to scroll through the popover and select 'Build All' > 'My Mac 64 Bit'...

###Step 6

With the correct scheme selected in Step 5, you are now ready to build and compile the application. To do so, either press ⇧⌘I or click on 'Product' > 'Build For' > 'Profiling' in the menu bar up top. This makes sure that you get a release build that makes use of all those optimizations.

###Step 7

This will begin compiling the application. This process should take around 5 minutes or so to complete...

###Step 8

XCode has compiled OpenEmu. Simply search for OpenEmu.app in Finder, right-click on it and select 'Open Enclosing Folder'.

![Select 'Open Enclosing Folder'](http://f.cl.ly/items/30291R3k3h071q0x0G0q/Image%202013.03.04%2000:39:28.png)

This should show you the application inside the 'Release' folder.

You can of course launch the application directly from this folder, or, feel free to move it over to your applications folder so it is easier to find and launch next time!.

###Step 9

From here, you can begin playing your favorite games and using the application as normal (assuming that the source code you downloaded is in a usable state!)....

### Cleaning Up Previous Versions

If you have installed or used earlier versions of OpenEmu, some things have changed that require manual cleanup to ensure proper functionality of OpenEmu 1.0.

### A) Remove older cores.

Navigate to your ~/Library/Application Support/OpenEmu folder and delete it.

### B) Remove older preferences

Navigate to your home folder, library: ~/Library/Preferences/ and remove the org.openemu.OpenEmu.plist preferences file there, and any files labeled OpenEmu.

### C) Proceed to Step 1 to compile OpenEmu.
