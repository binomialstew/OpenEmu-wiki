# Bugs and Crashes
- Import:
 - ~~Double clicking a ROM in Finder to import *sometimes* crashes OE https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bc5ab9d23ea67dd7863a~~ might be fixed by 335598662189
 - ~~Zipped ROMs that end up in the import issue resolver will not import (https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/issues/1694)~~ 5fdad1e5b189dcb67d9272df93e1cb5e756a50d1
- UI:

    - ~~can be reproduced by having at least one spinner visible and then resizing the window. after a few seconds console will be spammed with those messages (blocking the app) and you can't switch consoles or launch a game without heavy glitching. Also happens when spinner animation is disabled.~~ 90951ed63f9db68cfb60b37a1d954f74948f0a8f
 - INAppStoreWindow exception (https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a77996283181f43b3a44)

 - save states

- ~~check in-game save state notification~~ 6f082f03a3019f1385f308b0e44f5319fd9aab8c
- ~~Alerts: Whenever you type into one of our modals, the keyboard presses will register for the both text field and emulator control. Should drop responder status whenever text field is in focus?~~ fb9a210291fa8006811c8cbe77f1999e8ce655bd
- ~~Alerts: (related to above) Press ‘save hotkey’ twice makes two dialogs appear. To replicate, bind a 'special key' for 'Save' and press the button over and over.~~ 6f082f03a3019f1385f308b0e44f5319fd9aab8c
