The OpenEmu development team is very small and the early state of the software means that many people are reporting problems. To help development help you better, please follow the steps below when submitting issues to the GitHub tracker.

### Preliminary troubleshooting

If you're having an issue, please perform some preliminary troubleshooting before submitting to the tracker. Some examples (not all will apply to every situation):

* Try restarting OpenEmu.
* Try restarting the computer.
* Try a different game.
* Try a different system (e.g., Super NES instead of NES).
* Try a different controller.
* Try a different filter.
* Try an internal drive (if using a network share or external drive).

### Existing/known issues

Please try to search for your issue before creating a ticket, as it might already have been reported. To search the issue tracker, go to the [Issues page](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/issues) and then enter your search terms in the field at the very top of the page (where it says *Search or type a command*).

If you find a ticket that matches the problem you're having, please do not create a new one.

Please also do not '+1' tickets on the issue tracker. If it hasn't been determined that the issue affects multiple users, you can mention that you're experiencing it as well, but if the problem is already established, adding '+1's will only annoy people. 

Of course, if you feel you have any other useful information to add, you are encouraged to post it in the comments.

### Required ticket information

If you do decide to submit an issue, please be as detailed and specific as possible about what's happening. Include the exact steps you took to make the problem happen (even if they seem obvious), and exactly what the problem looked like. If it's difficult to describe, try [taking a screenshot](http://support.apple.com/kb/ph11229) and dragging it into the issue field (or you can upload it to a site like [Imgur](http://imgur.com)).
